# Quick Start Guide - Wavin Sentio v2

## What You Have Now

I've created the **foundation** for a modern Wavin Sentio ESPHome component based on the architecture of the Wavin AHC 9000 v3 project. Here's what's ready:

### ✅ Complete Files
- **Python configuration layer** (`__init__.py`, `climate.py`, `sensor.py`)
- **C++ header files** (`wavin_sentio.h`, `climate.h`)  
- **Documentation** (`README.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)
- **Example configuration** (`example.yaml`)

### ⚠️ What Still Needs Work
The C++ **implementation files** (.cpp) need to be created to actually handle the Modbus communication. These will contain the logic for:
- Reading/writing registers
- Polling channels
- Managing state
- Handling climate control

## Key Improvements You'll Get

### Before (Old Sentio Component)
```yaml
# Had to manually define EVERY register
sensor:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    name: "Room 1 temperatur"
    id: temperatur_channel_1
    address: 104
    filters:
      - multiply: 0.01

number:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    name: "Room 1 setpunkt"
    id: temperatur_setpunkt_channel_1
    address: 119
    write_lambda: "payload = ..."

climate:
  - platform: sentio
    current_temp_sensor_id: temperatur_channel_1
    target_temp_sensor_id: temperatur_setpunkt_channel_1
```

### After (New Sentio v2)
```yaml
# Component handles everything internally!
wavin_sentio:
  id: sentio
  modbus_controller_id: sentio_controller
  channel_01_friendly_name: "Room 1"

climate:
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    name: "Room 1"
    channel: 1  # That's it!

sensor:
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    channel: 1
    type: battery  # Just specify what you want
```

## New Features You'll Gain

### 1. Group Climates
Combine multiple rooms into one climate entity:
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    name: "Main Floor"
    members: [1, 2, 3]  # Combines 3 rooms
```

### 2. Floor Temperature Support
Use floor sensor as primary temperature:
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    name: "Bathroom Floor"
    channel: 4
    use_floor_temperature: true
```

### 3. Multiple Sensor Types
```yaml
sensor:
  # Battery level
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    channel: 1
    type: battery

  # Air temperature
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    channel: 1
    type: temperature

  # Floor temperature (auto-detected)
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    channel: 1
    type: floor_temperature

  # Humidity
  - platform: wavin_sentio
    channel: 1
    type: humidity
```

## Next Steps to Complete

### Option 1: Implement C++ Files Yourself
If you're comfortable with C++, you can implement:
1. `wavin_sentio.cpp` - Main Modbus communication logic
2. `climate.cpp` - Climate entity behavior
3. `sensor.cpp` - Sensor entity behavior

Reference the AHC 9000 v3 implementation for guidance:
- https://github.com/heinekmadsen/esphome_wavinahc9000v3/tree/main/esphome/components/wavin_ahc9000

### Option 2: Adapt Existing Code
You could adapt your current working configuration:
1. Keep using the old component for now
2. Gradually implement the new structure
3. Test each piece incrementally

### Option 3: Request Implementation Help
I can help you implement the C++ files step by step:
1. Start with basic channel reading
2. Add setpoint writing
3. Add climate entity logic
4. Add group support
5. Add floor temperature support

## What You Can Do Right Now

### 1. Review the Architecture
Read `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` to understand how it all fits together.

### 2. Review the Documentation
Check `README.md` for the complete feature list and usage examples.

### 3. Compare with AHC 9000 v3
Look at the AHC 9000 v3 component to see:
- How they structure the C++ implementation
- How they handle Modbus communication
- How they implement climate groups
- How they do YAML generation

### 4. Plan Your Implementation
Decide which features you want first:
- Basic single channel climate? (simplest)
- Group climates? (very useful)
- Floor temperature support? (if you have floor probes)
- Battery sensors? (nice to have)
- YAML generation helpers? (optional, for onboarding)

## Testing Strategy

When you implement the C++ files, test in this order:

1. **Basic Communication**
   - Can read register 104 (temperature)?
   - Can read register 119 (setpoint)?

2. **Single Climate**
   - Does temperature update?
   - Can you change setpoint?
   - Does it persist to device?

3. **Multiple Channels**
   - Do all channels poll correctly?
   - No bus contention issues?

4. **Group Climate**
   - Do member temps average correctly?
   - Do setpoint changes sync to all members?

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Floor temperature detection working?
   - Battery readings correct?
   - Friendly names appearing?

## Your Current Working Setup

You already have a working configuration with:
- 4 channels configured
- Modbus communication established
- Climate entities working

This new component will let you **simplify** that configuration significantly while **adding** powerful new features like groups and floor temperature support.

## Questions to Consider

Before implementing, think about:

1. **How many channels do you actually have?**
   - The component supports up to 16

2. **Do you want group climates?**
   - Great for open floor plans

3. **Do any thermostats have floor probes?**
   - Floor temperature feature only works with probes

4. **What sensors do you want?**
   - Battery, temperature, humidity, floor temp?

5. **Do you need child lock switches?**
   - Can prevent manual adjustments

## Ready to Implement?

When you're ready to implement the C++ files, I can help you with:
- Specific Modbus register reading/writing code
- Climate entity state management
- Group averaging logic
- Floor temperature detection
- Error handling and retry logic
